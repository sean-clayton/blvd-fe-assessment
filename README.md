# Intro

Hi ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to the Boulevard frontend engineer take-home assessment!

Weâ€™re so glad you decided to engage in our recruiting process and designed this assessment to be fun, flexible, and let you strut your stuff.

This assessment is purposefully open-ended. We want to see your style â€“ everything from setting up your favorite tools to how you document your code.

We recommend seeing how far you can get in 4 hours.

Soâ€¦ letâ€™s jump in!

## The project

Youâ€™re going to build an _email verification_ web app that mimics the type of stuff we build at Boulevard!

### Here are the requirements:

- Use this repository as a starting point - it is based off of [Create React App](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/material-ui-vite-ts)
- Create a form that lets a user enter an email address
- Consume the [DISIFY email verification API](https://www.disify.com/) to find out whether the email address is valid or disposable and expose that information to the user
- Track the history of validation requests that have been made by the user and show that on the page

### Hereâ€™s how we will evaluate:

- The application is feature complete and bug free - we value attention to detail and care about the quality of our work.
- You added linting and style controls - we care about consistent styles and engineered controls to enforce them.
- You added tests - we care about the quality of our code and put controls in place to ensure quality now and in the future.
- You used external libraries where appropriate - we donâ€™t want to reinvent the wheel and would rather spend our time investing in what truly adds value to our customers. Consider component libraries, network libraries, state libraries, etc.
- You used clean code principles and component composition - we prioritize clean code to enhance readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- You used TypeScript to help achieve clean code - we use Typescript to enhance readability, maintainability, and code safety.
- You added accessibility controls - our mission is to make self care accessible to ALL. This includes things like supporting screen readers and keyboard form navigation
- You commit your work in small, atomic commits - we practice continuous integration and deployment through small, incrementally deliverable units of work 


### Running the app

You will need to use NodeJS version 16.14.2 or greater.
